			<b>What is bullying?</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Bullying happens when someone hurts or scares another person on purpose
			and the person being bullied has a hard time defending themselves. So,
			everyone needs to get involved to help stop it. It is behaviour that makes
			the person being bullied feel afraid or uncomfortable. There are many ways
			that young people bully each other, even if they don’t realize it at the
			time. Some of these include:
		</p>
		<ul style="font-size: 24px;">
			<li>Punching, shoving and other acts that hurt people physically</li>
			<li>Spreading bad rumours about people</li>
			<li>Keeping certain people out of a group</li>
			<li>Teasing people in a mean way</li>
			<li>Getting certain people to “gang up” on others.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<h2>
			<b>How common is bullying?</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			In Canada, at least 1 in 3 adolescent students have reported being
			bullied. Almost half of Canada parents have reported having a child that
			is the victim of bullying. Studies have found bullying occurs once every
			seven minutes on the playground and once every 25 minutes in the
			classroom. In the majority of cases, bullying stops within 10 seconds when
			peers intervene, or do not support the bullying behaviour. That is why
			it’s important to stand up.
		</p>
		<br>

		<h2>
			<b>Mythsbuster</b>
		</h2>
		<p>
			Myth #1 – “Children have got to learn to stand up for themselves.” Reality
			– Children who get up the courage to complain about being bullied are
			saying they’ve tried and can’t cope with the situation on their own. Treat
			their complaints as a call for help. In addition to offering support, it
			can be helpful to provide children with problem solving and assertiveness
			training to assist them in dealing with difficult situations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Myth #2 – “Children should hit back – only harder.” Reality – This could
			cause serious harm. People who bully are often bigger and more powerful
			than their victims. This also gives children the idea that violence is a
			legitimate way to solve problems. Children learn how to bully by watching
			adults use their power for aggression. Adults have the opportunity to set
			a good example by teaching children how to solve problems by using their
			power in appropriate ways.
		</p>
		<p>
			Myth #3 – “It builds character.” Reality – Children who are bullied
			repeatedly, have low self-esteem and do not trust others. Bullying damages
			a person’s self-concept.
		</p>
		<p>
			Myth #4 – “Sticks and stones can break your bones but words can never hurt
			you.” Reality – Scars left by name-calling can last a lifetime.
		</p>
		<p>
			Myth #5 – “That’s not bullying. They’re just teasing.” Reality – Vicious
			taunting hurts and should be stopped.
		</p>
		<p>
			Myth #6 – “There have always been bullies and there always will be.”
			Reality – By working together as parents, teachers and students we have
			the power to change things and create a better future for our children. As
			a leading expert, Shelley Hymel, says, “It takes a whole nation to change
			a culture”. Let’s work together to change attitudes about bullying. After
			all, bullying is not a discipline issue – it is a teaching moment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Myth #7 – “Kids will be kids.” Reality – Bullying is a learned behaviour.
			Children may be imitating aggressive behaviour they have seen on
			television, in movies or at home. Research shows that 93% of video games
			reward violent behaviour. Additional findings show that 25% of boys aged
			12 to 17 regularly visit gore and hate internet sites, but that media
			literacy classes decreased the boys’ viewing of violence, as well as their
			acts of violence in the playground. It is important for adults to discuss
			violence in the media with youth, so they can learn how to keep it in
			context. There is a need to focus on changing attitudes toward violence.
